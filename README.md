## Why?

`styled-components` are more like CSS than JS: https://github.com/metamn/styled-components

## Install

```
yarn add react-jss (or styled-jss ???)
```

See: https://cssinjs.org/react-jss

## Usage

## Notes

- There is no API documentation
- There is no forum just a chat
- Only 272 results on Stack Overflow for `react-jss` ... hmm 500 for `styled-components`
- It seems to be a single man show (@kof) who is a little little bit difficult ...
- According to him:

> styled-jss is fast, but it's not react-jss
> we are working on a new styled api built in in react-jss but it's not out yet
